This is the Fitness app which I have created using flutter it is not the finished version but it is partially complete. I created this app with the mind set that people can workout with proper diet plan and training shedule without the use of gym instructor and dietitian.

For now this app has a Login page, Sign up page, workout page, profile(not completed) and the report page(not completed). 

Password = 'Pass@123' for Login page
